# BAM

Inspired by [BIG-ASS MESSAGE](https://bigassmessage.com), but open-source and improved.

## New features

- Open-source!
- More themes!
- Unicode support!
- Cheaper!*

* Cheaper because it can be hosted on a static web server like GitHub Pages. Shared URLs include all info about the message encoded on it. Users willing shorter URLs can use external URL shorteners like TinyURL or bit.ly. This avoid issues with message data having to be stored in someone servers.

(Some might still need to be implemented, but all of those are planned.)
